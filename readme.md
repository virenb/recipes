### Summary
This Node.js Capstone project is a web application which allows a user to search for recipe ideas based on ingredient he or she inputs into the search. The Food API used was from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/) (thank you!).

### Usage 

### Technologies Used
This web application was build using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript, and Node.js. For front end, Bootstrap 3 was utilized. For database and storage use, MongoDB, Mongoose, and mLab were used. Other tools used included npm and Express. The endpoint testing was done using Mocha and Chai. Travis CI was used for continuous integration. The app was deployed on Cloud9 (as seen on the above link). The data was supplied from the Food API from Spoonacular.
